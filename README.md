# Minecraft-YML-Swear-Words-List.
## About
I made this repository as a list of swear words to be used with Minecraft plugin configs for plugins that don't have a default or as large of a swear filter as this.
## Credit
I originally made this with [⚜️BAC - ♛ Discord Bot ♛ - ⛔Anti Swear -⛔Anti Commands - ⚡Staff Chat⚜️](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9A%9C%EF%B8%8Fbac-%E2%99%9B-discord-bot-%E2%99%9B-%E2%9B%94anti-swear-%E2%9B%94anti-commands-%E2%9A%A1staff-chat%E2%9A%9C%EF%B8%8F.89334/) in mind, however you could practically use this for any Anti-Swear plugin that uses this format.

Credit to the [Google Profanity Words](https://github.com/RobertJGabriel/Google-profanity-words) for providing a list of all swear words. All I really did was use python to format it! This repo also includes the code that formats it incase you'd like to use your own format.
